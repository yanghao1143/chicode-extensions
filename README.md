## Original Zed Extensions README

This is the central repository containing the extensions available for [Chi Code](https://chicode.com/) (forked from Zed).

## Getting started

See the [Developing Extensions](https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/developing-extensions) docs for how to develop and publish your extension

Looking for extension ideas? Check out:

- [Top language requests](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alanguage+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)

If an issue requesting an extension is tagged with the `needs infrastructure` label, it indicates that the extension cannot currently be developed due to the absence of necessary system infrastructure.
